# Adjustable-RF-Attenuator-by-WA2FZW

Version 2.0 of this project is a low power adjustable RF attenuator capable of providing 0.0 to 31.2 dB of attenuation in 0.5 dB steps. Version 1.0 was designed to provide 0.0 to 63 dB in 0.5 dB steps, but I was unable to get that version built due to my not so good SMD assembly skills.

The device is intended for low power applications such as providing variable attenuation between an RF preamplifier and an SDR (that's what I use it for).

I provided the Version 1.0 documentation, Gerber files and software here should someone want to attempt making it work (if you do, let me know).

Version 2.0 has been thoroughly tested and the performance measurements are in the documentation.
